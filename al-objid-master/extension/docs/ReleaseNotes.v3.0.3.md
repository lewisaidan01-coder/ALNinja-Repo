## ⚠️ In case you missed... Ninja Has Moved to a Commercial SaaS Platform

**There is no more free public Ninja backend.** AL Object ID Ninja has transitioned from a free public service to a commercial Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) platform. All users need to make a choice about how they want to use Ninja going forward.

### Migration Period

**Until January 1, 2026, the SaaS service is not billed and is free of charge.** This grace period allows organizations to migrate either to self-hosted deployment or to set up their subscription for the SaaS platform without any immediate cost. Use this time to evaluate your options and make the transition that works best for your team.

### Your Options

You have two paths forward:

#### Option 1: "Free" (Self-Hosted)

You can continue using Ninja at no subscription cost by deploying and maintaining your own backend infrastructure:

-   **Deploy your own backend**: You need to set up and deploy the Ninja backend Azure Functions to your own Azure subscription
-   **Pay for your own Azure infrastructure**: All Azure costs (storage, compute, etc.) are your responsibility
-   **Maintain it yourself**: You are responsible for:
    -   Upgrading to new versions of the backend
    -   Configuring all clients to point to your backend
    -   Ensuring all team members are synchronized and using the correct configuration
    -   Managing security, backups, and all operational aspects

This option gives you full control but requires significant technical expertise and ongoing maintenance effort.

#### Option 2: Hassle-Free (Public Endpoints)

Stay on the public endpoints and let us handle all the infrastructure, maintenance, and upgrades:

-   **Free Personal Subscription**: Available for individual developers (even for commercial projects)
-   **Paid Subscription**: For teams and organizations who want the convenience of managed infrastructure

With this option, you simply use Ninja—we handle everything else. No deployment, no maintenance, no infrastructure management, no configuration, and most importantly - no change in your end-user experience.
